core.matrix.stats
=================

This project is now *DEPRECATED*. Equivalent functionality has now been integrated into the main [core.matrix](http://github.com/mikera/core.matrix) library.

## Overview

Statistical function library for Clojure using `core.matrix`

The purpose of this library is to provide useful statistical functions 
which are not part of core.matrix itself but are generally useful in statistical computing.

All of the functions are implemented on top of the `core.matrix` API: this means that you 
can safely use them with any `core.matrix` implementation, and you will gain the performance 
benefits of fast `core.matrix` implementations

`core.matrix.stats` is intended to be complementary with Incanter, and adopts the same 
conventions wherever possible.

### Status

This project is now *DEPRECATED*. Equivalent functionality has now been integrated into the main core.matrix project

### Usage

`core.matrix.stats` is available from Clojars:

 - https://clojars.org/net.mikera/core.matrix.stats

Ensure you have `core.matrix.stats` added to your project as a dependency, and it will be ready to use.

### Examples

```clojure
(use 'clojure.core.matrix.stats)

;; Calculate the mean of four vectors

(mean [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9] [10 11 12]])
=> [5.5 6.5 7.5]

;; calculate the sample variance of a set of numbers
(variance [1 2 3 4 5])
=> 2.5
```
